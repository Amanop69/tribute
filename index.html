                <h1 class="head1">Founder of Apple</h1>
                <p class="para">Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief executive and chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="para">Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different pursuits before co-founding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="para">While Jobs was always an intelligent and innovative thinker, his youth was riddled with frustrations over formal schooling. Jobs was a prankster in elementary school due to boredom, and his fourth-grade teacher needed to bribe him to study. Jobs tested so well, however, that administrators wanted to skip him ahead to high school — a proposal that his parents declined.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="para">In 1976, when Jobs was just 21, he and Wozniak started Apple Computer in the Jobs’ family garage. They funded their entrepreneurial venture by Jobs selling his Volkswagen bus and Wozniak selling his beloved scientific calculator. Jobs and Wozniak are credited with revolutionizing the computer industry with Apple by democratizing the technology and making machines smaller, cheaper, intuitive and accessible to everyday consumers.</p>

                        <b>CO-FOUNDED A COMPANY NAMED APPLE ALONG WITH STEVE WOZNIAC - </b> <p class="achieve">In the period of 1974-75, Steve Jobs occasionally met up with former high school friend Steve Wozniac, who worked at Hewett Packard (HP) Company. It was during this period that Jobs became aware that his friend was developing his own computer logic board and suggested that they go into business together selling it. A few months later HP formally turned down Wozniac’s design. In April of 1976 Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniac and Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs’s Los Altos home on Coast Drive. The primary objective of the company was to sell Wozniac’s designed machine which was named Apple</p>

                        <b>HE DELIVERED THE FIRST COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PERSONAL COMPUTER - </b> <p class="achieve">Launched in 1977, Apple II was a major technological leap as compared to its predecessor. Jobs and Wozniac had sold about 175 Apple I in the previous year but Apple II was the first consumer product to be sold by Apple Computer. Jobs had convinced Mike Markkula (former Intel product marketing manager) who had put up a $60,000 investment in the company. The first Apple II was sold on the 10th of June, 1977 and it would continue to sell for 17 more years. When production ended in 1993, Apple had sold close to 6 million Apple II models including 1.25 million Apple II GS models alone. Due to this phenomenal success, Apple II series of home computers are regarded as one of the first successful mass produced microcomputer products.</p>

                    <li class="list2">
                        <b>HE INTRODUCED GUI, BUILT IN SCREEN AND MOUSE INTO A PERSONAL COMPUTER - </b> <p class="achieve">The Macintosh, later referred to as Mac, was the first commercially successful personal computer that had a graphical user interface (GUI) and a mouse rather than the command line of its predecessors. This was a vital step that changed the personal computer industry.

                        <b>HE WAS AWARDED OVER 450 PATENTS AS HE REVOLUTIONIZED SIX MAJOR INDUSTRIES - </b> <p class="achieve">Steve Jobs’ ability to visualize, conceptualize and deliver path breaking products through his team and companies took the world aback and take notice. During his lifetime of work as a creative entrepreneur he focused on the “look and feel“ of his products and aspired for perfection in design. He was awarded close to 450 patents ranging from computers, touch based interfaces, keyboards, portables to staircases, clasps and sleeves. Along the way he revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing and digital publishing.</p>

                    <li class="list2">
                        <b>HE WAS BEHIND THE SUCCESSFUL ANIMATION STUDIO PIXAR - </b> <p class="achieve">After leaving Apple in 1985 due to differences with the company’s CEO John Sculley, Jobs launched NeXT Inc. with $7 million. Although known for their engineering design, NeXT computers were not competing well with less costly alternatives from companies like Sun Microsystems. In 1986, Jobs put in another $10 million as an investment in the spin–out of The Graphics Group from Lucasfilm’s computer graphics division. This would later be renamed as Pixar. The idea was to leverage NeXT computing technology as a powerful rendering option for computer graphics. Although Steve had envisioned Pixar to develop graphics-rendering hardware and software, the business eventually evolved into an animation studio.</p>
